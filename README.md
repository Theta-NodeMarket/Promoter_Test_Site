# Promoter Test Site

This simple front end is responsible for displaying ads as if it was a promoter's website. This is to show proof of concept and to allow us to test displaying and tracking data associated with ads.

Here we showcase how adding our script to a website can enable promoters to generate ad revenue.

Looking to add this functionality to your website? After creating a promoter account on the NodeMarket Platform, add the required script to get started.
