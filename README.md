# Promoter Test Site

This minimalistic front-end solution assumes the role of simulating a promoter's website, showcasing the proof of concept and facilitating the examination of advertisement display and associated data tracking.

We demonstrate the ability for promoters to generate advertising revenue by incorporating our script into their websites. Feel free to explore the implementation by accessing the following link:

Are you interested in integrating this functionality into your own website? Begin by creating a promoter account on the NodeMarket Platform, then proceed to add the necessary script to get started.
